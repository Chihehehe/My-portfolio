                    <h2>My Journey Into Tech & Why DevelopHer üë©üèª‚Äçüíªüíñ</h2>
                    <p>How the DevelopHer program aligns with my aspirations to
                        become a software engineer and contribute to closing the
                        gender gap in technology.</p>

                        <h3>My Tech Journey</h3>
                        <p>It all started when my Facebook account got hacked. I
                            was frustrated and wanted to understand how it
                            happened‚Äîand more importantly, how to prevent it.
                            That curiosity led me to explore how the internet
                            and websites actually work. At first, I just wanted
                            to protect my own information, but while trying to
                            learn the basics online, I stumbled into the world
                            of coding.</p>

                        <p>What began as a personal mission quickly turned into
                            something I genuinely enjoyed. I was fascinated by
                            how you could build things from scratch with just a
                            few lines of code. The more I learned, the more I
                            realized how powerful and creative programming can
                            be. That's when I decided to seriously pursue
                            software engineering‚Äînot just as a skill, but as a
                            career path.</p>

                <h3>Why DevelopHer Matters</h3>
                <p>MYOB's DevelopHer program represents exactly what the tech
                    industry needs‚Äîa pathway specifically designed to bring more
                    women into software development. What makes this program
                    stand out is its recognition that talent exists in diverse
                    places and doesn't always follow traditional paths.</p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    <p>"MYOB launched DevelopHer and was a trailblazer for not just creating another pathway into tech but reshaping the industry. MYOB recognized the gap in gender diversity and took action, designing a program that empowers women to pivot into technology careers with no prior experience required‚Äîearning a salary while they learn."</p>
                </div>

                <p>This approach resonates deeply with me. The opportunity to
                    earn while learning breaks down one of the significant
                    barriers to career transition‚Äîfinancial stability. By
                    removing this obstacle, DevelopHer makes tech careers
                    accessible to women from all backgrounds and
                    circumstances.</p>

                    <p>I currently work as a waitress and a supervisor at a
                        Korean fine dining
                        BBQ restaurant. This part-time role has greatly improved
                        my communication skills, teamwork, and leadership. I'm
                        responsible for training new staff and managing the
                        store during busy hours, which has helped me become more
                        confident and organized.</p>

                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading books and playing
                        badminton with friends. These hobbies keep me balanced
                        and energized. For books, I'm currently into Dan Brown's novels‚Äîhis storytelling always keeps me hooked and makes me curious about the world. I love getting lost in a good story, and
                        badminton gives me a fun way to stay active while
                        bonding with others.</p>
