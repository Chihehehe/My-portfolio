                <h2>My Journey Into Tech üë©üèª‚Äçüíª</h2>
                <p>How my passion for coding started and where I hope it leads me in the future as a software engineer.</p>

                    <h3>My Tech Journey</h3>
                    <p>It all started when my Facebook account got hacked. I was frustrated and wanted to understand how it happened‚Äîand more importantly, how to prevent it. That curiosity led me to explore how the internet and websites actually work. At first, I just wanted to protect my own information, but while trying to learn the basics online, I stumbled into the world of coding.</p>

                    <p>What began as a personal mission quickly turned into something I genuinely enjoyed. I was fascinated by how you could build things from scratch with just a few lines of code. The more I learned, the more I realized how powerful and creative programming can be. That's when I decided to seriously pursue software engineering‚Äînot just as a skill, but as a career path.</p>
